## Project motivation
Placement is a time of fear for most students. All the students have questions regarding what are the best practices that need to be followed to get better placement and what are the parameters that would be checked by the recruitment officers at the time placement. Here is an attempt to understand the trends in placements

## Project overview
The project is an attempt to analyse the placement statistics and answer the following questions


## The folloing questions have been attempted to answer                                                                                    
Q1 Is work experience affecting the placement statics?                                                                                    
Q2 Are percentage really helpful for getting placed?                                                                                     
Q3 Which streams have a better chance of getting placed?

## Conclusion
We conclude that work experience matters and leads to better placement, percentage arenâ€™t the right measure to predict whether a person will be placed or not, further people in comm and Management have higher chances of getting placed and similarly those doing MBA specialization in Marketing and fin have higher chance of getting placed and with higher salary.
